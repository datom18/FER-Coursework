# Programming Language Translation - Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for three different assignments as a part of the course *Programming Language Translation* held at FER Computing Bachelor Programme.

These programs simulate three fundamental stages of translating and understanding a source program:
- lexical analysis
- syntax analysis
- semantic analysis
