# Operating Systems - Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for four different assignments as a part of the course *Operating Systems* held at FER Computing Bachelor Programme.

These laboratory assignments explore and simulate different elements of a modern operating system, such as signals, process synchronization using semaphores and monitors, and memory management schemes like paging.
