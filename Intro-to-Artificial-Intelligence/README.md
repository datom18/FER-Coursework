# Intro to Artificial Intelligence - Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for four different assignments as a part of the course *Intro to Artificial Intelligence* held at FER Computing Bachelor Programme.

## Assignment 1 - State space search

This assignment explores different state space search algorithms such as BFS, UCS and A-Star, as well as the importance of the heuristic function and its properties, and whether it is optimistic and consistent.

## Assignment 2 - Propositional logic theorem prover

In this assignment we implemented an automated reasoning system based on the refutation resolution algorithm.

## Assignment 3 - Supervised machine learning

In this assignment we explored the decision tree algorithm and analysed the problems and extensions of this machine learning algorithm.

## Assignment 4 - Neural networks and genetic algorithms

This assignment explored neural networks and the approach of using genetic algorithm as a mean of optimizing the network.
